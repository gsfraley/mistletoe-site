# Mistletoe for developers

The default engine in Mistletoe is called **Husk.**  It's meant to be an almost-empty shell that packages can run their own logic in.  Additional engines may be added later, potentially for future cross-compatibility with [Helm](https://helm.sh/).

The developer experience for **Mistletoe** is focused on pluggability.  The [WebAssembly interface](./developers/webassembly-interface.html) is very simple, so connections to the engine can be written in a small amount of code in any compatibile language.

But it's unreasonable to force a bootstrap step into the development of every package, so we'll be providing libraries providing higher-level abstractions and autogenerated interfaces for a few languages, [starting with Rust](./developers/for-rust-developers.html).
